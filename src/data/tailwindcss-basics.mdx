# Daily Hustle & Learning: The #KASHpeKASH Journey

In the ever-changing world of tech and self-growth, staying consistent is one of the hardest yet most rewarding habits to develop. That's what **#KASHpeKASH** is all about — a journey not just of skill-building but of mindset, discipline, and transformation.

> **KASHpeKASH** stands for **Knowledge, Acknowledge, Skill, Habit** — a mantra I live by every single day.

From Day 1 to now, every post has been a timestamp of my learning, my hustle, and my wins and failures. Whether it was mastering **GSAP animations**, building a **restaurant website** with the **MERN stack** and **Razorpay integration**, or simply learning to sit in silence and reflect — each day added a line to my growth story.

### 🔧 Tech Learnings

Some days were about **deep technical learning** — working on **Next.js components**, integrating **MongoDB**, or experimenting with frontend tools like **Lenis** and **Locomotive**.

### 💭 Mindset Shifts

Other days were more **philosophical** — when I realized the **power of silence**, the **value of mindset**, or the **importance of health** when the body says no.

### 🤝 Community & Events

What makes this journey special is not just the work, but the **community and experiences** along the way.

- Attended **MongoDB.local**
- Met **Ashish Tulsian** (CEO of Restroworks)
- Joined **Google I/O Extended** to witness the power of new AI tools

Each interaction, each talk, each line of code — added another layer to who I’m becoming.

### 🔥 The Meaning of Aalekh (आलेख)

> **Aalekh** means a sketch, a written piece, or an inscription — often associated with **Lord Shiva** and symbolizes a soul on a learning path.

I am a sketch, a writing in progress, a divine script being penned with each action and thought.

### 🚀 Final Note

This is not a sprint; it's a **disciplined, daily walk toward mastery**. 

So here’s to the daily hustle, the late nights, the small wins, and the bigger lessons.

> **Stay consistent. Stay curious. Stay humble.**
